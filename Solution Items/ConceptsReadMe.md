-----------------------------------------------------

* S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
	- every class, or similar structure, in your code should have only one job to do
* O: Open closed Principle (OCP)
	- A software module/class is open for extension and closed for modification
* L: Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)
	- You should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification
* I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
	- No class should be forced to implement any method(s) of an interface they don’t use. Secondly, instead of creating large, 
	- create multiple smaller interfaces with the aim that the clients should only think about the methods that are of interest to them.
* D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.
